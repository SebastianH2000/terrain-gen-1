# Sandbox Game With Terrain Generation
I made this project to push myself out of my programming comfort zone, and to investigate how games like Terraria can be made. I learned a lot from making this, and I consider it to be the most complex thing that I've made from scratch in my programming career so far.

This game has no winning or losing, it's just a sandbox game!

You can use arrow keys or the WASD keys to move the character. Left and right keys move the character (the character is just a rectangle) in that direction and the up arrow jumps. The down arrow doesn't do anything as of now. You can use the mouse to break and place tiles, right click breaks a block and left click places it. Use the 1-9 number keys to navigate the hotbar.
